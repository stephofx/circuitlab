Circuit Lab Rules

Overall Allowed Actions
Turn-Based:
-Each turn can be a “setting” or “running” move: the player can “set” a circuit part 
on the grid or “run” their circuit to gain currency for a final variable time (5 seconds)
This results in end of move and shifts the control to the next player.
End game:
-The game ends when all spots on the grid are filled.

The Setup
-The game is setup on a 3D cube in which the cube is partitioned into a 5 x 5 grid on each face. 
Each grid square is open to be “set” by a circuit part except for the destination power device. 
Normal grid square
-This grid square does nothing except allow for circuit part to be placed.
Currency grid square
-This grid square measures the current of the circuit part on top of it in order to calculate currency, which is (current) multiplied by (time).
Destination grid square
-This grid square is the final voltage measurement of the circuit, determining which grid is winning or has won. 
Source grid square
-This grid square is the power source of the player; it is designated for one player only and is opposite the grid square of the destination grid square. The player must begin their circuit here. The game will assume DC power source.

Circuit Parts
-A variety of circuit parts are available for the player to utilize in game.
Wire
-This is the basis of the circuit; it connects different parts of the circuit together and ultimately forms the loop.
Resistor
-This increases the resistance of the circuit. This can lead to changes in voltage based on Ohm’s Law. 
Generator
-This creates a power source for a circuit not beginning at the source grid square.
Capacitor
-Cheap, short-term power boost
Transformer
-Expensive, can boost or lower voltage.
Diode
Diodes will control one directional flow.
Switches (Relays, Hand-actuated)
Switches can turn a circuit on or off by connecting/disconnecting it.

Currency
-Currency is defined by the current of the circuit at a currency grid square multiplied by the time given to run the circuit.

-The time variable is constant and is always 5 seconds.

-Currency is used to buy circuit parts, which are priced proportional to their usefulness in th game.
